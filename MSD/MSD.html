        who captained the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_national_cricket_team">
          <em>Indian national team</em></a>
        in limited-overs formats from 2007 to 2017 and in Test cricket from
        2008 to 2014. Under his captaincy, India won the inaugural 2007 ICC
        World Twenty20, the 2010 and 2016 Asia Cups, the 2011 ICC Cricket
        World Cup and the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy. A right-handed

        with more than <strong>10,000</strong> runs scored and is considered
        an effective<strong> "finisher"</strong> in limited-overs formats. He
        is widely regarded as one of the greatest<em> wicket-keeper</em>
        batsmen and captains in the history of the game. He was also the first
        wicket-keeper to effect

      <h2 id="early-life">Early life and background</h2>
      Dhoni was born in Ranchi, Bihar (now in
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jharkhand"> Jharkhand), </a> and
      he hails from a <em> Hindu Rajput family.</em> His paternal village
      Lwali is in the Lamgara block of the Almora District of
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uttarakhand"> Uttarakhand.</a>
      Dhoni is a fan of
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Gilchrist">
        Adam Gilchrist </a>, and his childhood idols were cricket teammate
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar">
        Sachin Tendulkar </a>, Bollywood actor Amitabh Bachchan and singer Lata Mangeshkar.
      <br><br>
      Dhoni studied at
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAV_Jawahar_Vidya_Mandir,_Shyamali">
        DAV Jawahar Vidya Mandir</a>, Shyamali, Ranchi, Jharkhand where he initially excelled in badminton
      and
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football">
        football</a>
      and was selected at
      district
      and club level in these sports. Dhoni was a
      goalkeeper for his football team and was sent to play cricket for a
      local cricket club by his football coach. Though he had not played
      cricket, Dhoni impressed with his wicket-keeping skills and became the
      regular wicketkeeper at the Commando cricket club (1995–1998). His
      colleagues remember him as a very honest, straightforward employee of
      the Indian Railways. But Dhoni also had a mischievous side to his
      personality. Once, while staying at the railway quarters, Dhoni and a
      couple of his friends covered themselves in white bedsheets and walked
      around in the complex late in the night. The night guards were fooled
      into believing that there were ghosts moving around in the complex. The
      story made big news on the next day.

      <h2>Early life</h2>
      <h3 id="Bihar">Bihar cricket team</h3>
      Dhoni made his
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranji_Trophy"> Ranji Trophy</a>
      debut for Bihar in the 1999–2000 season, as an eighteen-year-old. He
      made a half century in his debut match scoring 68* in the second innings
      against Assam cricket team.[46] Dhoni finished the season with 283 runs
      in 5 matches. Dhoni scored his maiden first-class century while playing
      for Bihar against Bengal in the 2000/01 season. <br /><br />

      <h3 id="Jharkand">Jharkhand cricket team</h3>

      In the Duleep Trophy finals, Dhoni was picked over international
      cricketer Deep Dasgupta to represent East Zone.[54] He scored a fighting
      half-century in the second innings in a losing cause.[55] Dhoni's talent
      was discovered via the BCCI's small-town talent-spotting initiative
      TRDW. Dhoni was discovered by TRDO Prakash Poddar, captain of Bengal in
      the 1960s, when he saw Dhoni play for Jharkhand at a match in Jamshedpur
      in 2003, and sent a report to the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Cricket_Academy">National Cricket Academy</a>.

      <p>
      <h3 id="A">India A team</h3>
      He was recognised for his efforts in the 2003/04 season, especially in
      the One Day format and was picked for the India A squad for a tour of
      Zimbabwe and Kenya. Dhoni helped India A chase down their target of
      223 against Pakistan A with a half-century. Dhoni scored 362 runs in 6
      innings at an average of 72.40 and his performance in the series
      received attention from the then Indian captain – Sourav Ganguly[62]
      and Ravi Shastri, amongst others.

    <section class="International career">
      <h2 id="international"> International career</h2>
      <h3 id="start">Start of ODI career</h3>
      The Indian ODI team in the early 2000s saw <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Dravid"> Rahul Dravid</a>
      as the wicket-keeper to ensure that the wicket-keeper spot
      didn't lack in batting talent. The team also saw the entry of wicket-keeper/batsmen from the junior ranks,
      with talents like Parthiv Patel and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinesh_Karthik"> Dinesh Karthik</a>
      (both India U-19 captains) named in the Test squads. With
      Dhoni making a mark in the India A squad, he was picked in the ODI squad for the Bangladesh tour in 2004/05.
      Dhoni did not have a great start to his ODI career, getting run out for a duck on debut. In spite of an
      average series against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_cricket_team">Bangladesh</a> , Dhoni was
      picked for the Pakistan ODI.

        <figcaption>Dhoni bowling in the nets</figcaption>
      </figure>

      In the second match of the series, Dhoni, in his fifth one-day international, scored 148 in <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACA-VDCA_Stadium"> Visakhapatnam</a> off only
      123 deliveries. Dhoni's 148 surpassed the earlier record for the highest score by an Indian wicket-keeper, a
      record that he would re-write before the end of the year. Sri Lanka had set India a target of 299 after a Kumar
      Sangakkara century and, in reply, India lost Tendulkar early. Dhoni was promoted to accelerate the scoring and
      ended the game with an unbeaten 183 off 145 balls, winning the game for India.honi ended the series with the
      highest run aggregate (346) and was awarded the <em> Man of the Series</em> award for
      his efforts. In December 2005,
      Dhoni was rewarded a B-grade contract by the BCCI.

      <h3 id="test">Test carrier</h3>
      Following his good one-day performance against Sri Lanka, Dhoni replaced Dinesh Karthik in December 2005 as the
      Indian teams' Test wicket-keeper. Dhoni scored 30 runs in his debut match, that was marred by rain. Dhoni
      came to the crease when the team was struggling at 109/5 and as wickets kept falling around him, he played an
      aggressive innings in which he was the last man to be dismissed. Dhoni made his maiden half-century in the
      second Test and his quick scoring rate (half century came off 51 balls) helped India set a target of 436 and the
      Sri Lankans were bowled out for 247. <br><br>

      He played his last series in the 2014–15 season in <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_cricket_team_in_Australia_in_2014%E2%80%9315"> India's tour of
        Australia</a> captaining India in the second and
      third tests; losing the second and drawing the third, trailing the series 2–0 before the Sydney Test. Following
      the third Test in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_Cricket_Ground"> Melbourne</a>, Dhoni announced
      his retirement from the format. In his last Test, he effected
      nine dismissals (eight catches and a stumping), and in the process, went past <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumar_Sangakkara"> Kumar Sangakkara</a> in the record for
      stumpings with 134 (in all three formats combined). He also set a record for effecting the most dismissals in
      a match by an Indian wicketkeeper until it was broken by Wriddhiman Saha in 2018. He finished his last
      innings unbeaten making 24 runs.

      <h3 id="t20i">T20I carrier</h3>
      Dhoni was a part of India's first-ever <strong> Twenty20 international match</strong>. He made debut against South
      Africa in
      December 2006. He was out for a duck but <strong> India</strong> won the match. He kept the wickets and effected
      one catch and a
      runout.

      On 12 February 2012, Dhoni made an unbeaten 44 to guide India to their first win over <strong> Australia</strong>
      at Adelaide. In
      the final over, he hit a monstrous six which travelled 112 meters off the bowling of Clint McKay. During the
      post-match presentation, he described this six as more important than the one he hit during the ICC World Cup
      final in 2011.

      He was named as captain and wicketkeeper of the 'Team of the Tournament' for the 2014 T20 World Cup by the ICC.

    <section class="World cup">
      <h2 id="world cup">World cup</h2>
      Dhoni has captained India in two World Cups. Under his captaincy, India won the World Cup in 2011 and reached the
      semifinals in 2015.
      <h3 id="2007">2007 Cricket World Cup</h3>
      Dhoni played his first ODI World Cup in 2007 in the Caribbean. India made an early exit from the tournament in the
      Group Stage. In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_Cricket_World_Cup"> 2007 Cricket World Cup</a>, India
      was placed in Group B with Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Bermuda. Rahul
      Dravid captained the team in this World Cup. In three matches India played, they managed to win only one against
      Bermuda while losing the rest from Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. In their first match against Bangladesh, India was
      all out in just 191 in 49.3 overs.

      <h3 id="2011">2011 Cricket World Cup</h3>
      Under Dhoni's captaincy, India won the 2011 World Cup. In the final against Sri Lanka, chasing 275, Dhoni promoted
      himself up the batting order, coming before an in-form Yuvraj Singh. When he came to bat, India needed more than
      six runs per over with three top-order batsmen already dismissed. He started building a good partnership with
      Gautam Gambhir. Due to good strokeplay and active running between wickets, they kept up with the required run
      rate. Dhoni was on 60 off 60 balls but later accelerated with a greater frequency of boundaries, ending with 91
      not out off 79 balls. <br> <br>The bat used by Dhoni in the final match was sold for ₹ 72 Lac. The money goes to
      Sakshi
      Rawat Foundation, operated by Dhoni's wife Sakshi Rawat to help orphan children.
      <h3 id="2015">2015 Cricket World Cup</h3>

      For the 2015 World Cup held in Australia and New Zealand, Dhoni was named the captain of the 30-member squad by
      the BCCI in December 2014.[161] Under his captaincy, India was able to go through to the semi-finals with ease,
      beating Bangladesh in the quarter-finals. However, they lost to host Australia in the semi-finals held at the
      Sydney Cricket Ground.

      <h3 id="2019">2019 Cricket World Cup</h3>

      Dhoni was named in the 15-man squad for the 2019 Cricket World Cup held in England and Wales. Dhoni scored some
      handy knocks in the tournament against South Africa, Australia, and West Indies, although he was criticised for
      his strike rate and 'lack of intent' in the match against Afghanistan and England. In the semi-final against New
      Zealand, Dhoni scored a fighting half-century in the second innings but was unfortunately run out at a crucial
      stage thus ending India's World Cup run.

      Dhoni was contracted by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai_Super_Kings"> Chennai Super Kings</a>
      for US$1.5 million. This made him the most expensive player in the
      IPL for the first season auctions. Under his captaincy, Chennai Super Kings won the 2010 and 2011 and 2018
      Indian Premier League titles and the 2010 and 2014 Champions League T20 titles.

      After the suspension of CSK for two years, he was bought by Rising Pune Supergiant for US$1.9 million in 2016, and
      was named captain. However, his team finished in 7th place. In 2017, his team reached the final, where they lost
      to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians"> Mumbai Indians</a>.

      In the <strong> 2018 IPL season</strong>, Chennai Super Kings returned to IPL, and Dhoni was again selected to
      lead the franchise.
      Dhoni scored 455 runs in the tournament and led his side to their third IPL title.
